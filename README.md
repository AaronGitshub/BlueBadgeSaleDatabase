# BlueBadgeSaleDatabase

This is the second major project, known as _Blue Badge_ that I did during the 12-week C#/.NET coding bootcamp that I began in April 2019 at 
**Eleven Fifty Academy**. 
The project is an N-tier MVC built using .NET Framework. 
The project is deployed at https://saledatabase.azurewebsites.net/

This project is intended to allow users to store, retrieve, edit, and delete real estate sales in a database. 
The users associate themselves with a company at the time of registration.

To clone this project return to the main page of the repository, on github. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
In the clone section, copy the url, open Git Bash, change the working directory, type _git clone_, copy the URL you copied, press _Enter_.
